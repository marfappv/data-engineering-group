# Project description and instruction for launching

## Description
This project merges two sources about NFTs: [Open Sea](https://opensea.io), another from [NFT Showroom](https://nftshowroom.com). It brings more labels regarding NFTs and broader variency of e-currencies, which may be used by data science teams, for example, to analyse determinant factors of price.
